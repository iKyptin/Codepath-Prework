## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I didn't use any outside resources aside the websites that show CSS color codes.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Although I encountered no challenges in creating the actual game, I encountered a lot of issues in uploading it to Github, specifically through Github Desktop. The tutorial that was provided on how to create the repository, commit, and push using Github Desktop seemed to be for an older project, and not the current one that uses Glitch. When I was trying to upload the project onto Github Desktop the way he was doing so, it would not give me the same results. While the tutorial showed that he had his prework in folders, mine was still saved onto Glitch. I downloaded the project from Glitch as a zipped file and tried to upload it through the same methods. I tried uploading the zipped, the extracted folder, the files themselves, and nothing worked. To solve this issue, I spent a while researching Glitch and Github, especially the latter since I have little experience with it. I also asked for help in the Pre-work Support Workspace. By the time I received an answer in the Pre-work Support Workspace, I had already figured out how to use the "Pull Request" feature in Github to merge the Glitch files onto my repository, but it was very helpful to have assurance that my solution was correct. Overall, I managed to become more acquainted with Github and Glitch through overcoming this challenge, so I would say it was very beneficial to experience this issue. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing my submission, I had a few questions about web development. First, I remembered Adobe's removal of Flash player last year, and how a lot of websites had to remove their Flash-based content. Since we were working on a game (albeit a simple one) it makes me wonder if these games that used Flash player are able to come back through the same methods that we used to make the Light and Sound game. I am intrigued as to why Flash player is necessary to run this games, and if these web-based games require Flash player to function, or if they can be recreated through different means.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time to complete this project, I would like to make it unique and "my own" in a way. First, I would like to ramp up the difficulty by making it random and adding difficulty levels that would alter the speed at which the computer delivers the clues. I would also add more buttons depending on the difficulty. I would also like to make a "shuffle" mode, where the buttons get switched around after the computer delivers the clues so you cannot rely on positioning to remember the order. If possible, I would like to make it "infinite" and add a leaderboard so that there is an incentive to reach a higher score.]
